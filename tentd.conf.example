"""An example configuration for pytentd"""

## Use a collection named tentd on the mongodb server
MONGODB_DB = 'tentd'

## The mongodb server location
# MONGODB_HOST = 'localhost'
# MONGODB_PORT = 27017

## Usernamed and password for the mongodb server
# MONGODB_USERNAME = 'example_username'
# MONGODB_PASSWORD = 'example_password'

## Threaded mode is needed so that flask can fetch urls that it provides.
## It is not needed for single user mode and is only used when running tentd
## from the command line.
# THREADED = False
